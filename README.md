# "Physics Concepts" Web Apps

This site was created to store web apps as supplementary materials of "Physics Concepts".

"Physics Concepts" is a video lecture series designed for high school students in Hong Kong. The project is a work in progress. For more information, visit:

As explained in [one of my videos](https://youtu.be/vvcmZF0D_Rs), I will probably stop making new web apps and focus my effort on making videos instead. Nevertheless, in the future, I may still recommend simulations made by other people and post links in this site.
