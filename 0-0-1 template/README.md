# Template

My first prototype had quite some problems, so I built this improved version. The end product looks exactly the same, but if you read through the code, you will find this version much easier to understand and manipulate. This served as a template from which the later web apps on this site were built. When I made new library extensions in the later apps, those extensions were also added to this template.
