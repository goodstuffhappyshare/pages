# First Prototype

This prototype was my first project in HTML5/CSS3. Before this prototype, the last time I developed something for the broswer was ages ago, when Flash was still a thing (and when it was still called "Macromedia" Flash). So basically I was trying to learn HTML5 by developing this prototype. Therefore, please don't consider this as a demonstration of good code by any means. Rather, this prototype kind of recorded how I re-learned web development in a completely changed internet. If you are interested to know the development process (for whatever reasons), see **_dev-log.txt**.

This prototype was immature in many ways... so I later built an improved version of it and used that as a template for the real web apps I made for "Physics Concepts".

As a side note, I relied heavily on jQuery when developing my web apps here, but then realized that jQuery is getting quite old by now (2021). If you are new to web development, maybe it is a better idea to learn something like [Umbrella JS](https://umbrellajs.com/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/), or maybe just use plain javascript, which means [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
