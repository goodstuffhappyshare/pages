(Aug 2020)

24/8 Monday

 - Research on jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery mobile
 - Decided to use jQuery UI + touch punch
 - First document structure design
   > main frame > control area + display area
   > mess with CSS properties such as margin, padding, overflow, flex box
 - Experiment with CSS media query
 - First main frame that detects screen size and change shape accordingly

25/8 Tuesday

 - Experiments with resizing interface components by CSS
 - Ditch flex box and CSS positioning!
   Absolute position for everything inside the main frame.
 - Re-do resizing of components by event handling in javascript
 - First experiments with jQuery and jQuery UI
 - Revise code
   > variable names are too long!
   > lines are too long! define new values and functions for repeated operations
 - Learned how to manupilate CSS with jQuery
 - Learned how the jQuery object works and how to define new functions
 - Get the force button to work
 - Set time interval is too choppy!
   Okay let's re-do and use request animation frame instead...


26/8 Wednesday

 - Research on manipulating SVG, found "D3" and "jQuery SVG"
 - Experiments with jQuery SVG
 - Learn about how SVG works... orz
 - Get the red line in the f-box working
 - Get the flying particle in the p-box working
 - Revise code
   > event handlers are too big! chop into smaller parts!
   > variable names start to get confusing! give accurate names!
     make clear distinction between "internal coordinates" and "display coordinates"!
   > handling interface within control area and display area
     should be in the "input" and "output" blocks instead of the "layout" block!
     code for interface is too far away from code for operations!
     maybe tomorrow...

27/8 Thursday

 - Move code from "layout" block to "input" and "output" blocks
 - Learn about groups in SVG and how to manipulate them
 - Realize that "SVG.js" seems to be a better option than "jQuery SVG"...
   Too late, next time.
 - Draw the arrows
 - Revise code
   > to handle 9 particles, the "OOP" mindset seems to be a better option
   > consider (1 particle + arrow + arrow) x9
     instead of (particles x9) + (arrow x9) + (arrow x9)
 - Get the whole thing working
 - Clean up the code
 - Tried 000webhost, screw it (no ad is a lie!)
   Tried GitHub Pages... Do I need to use my PC as a server?
   Went desperate and tried the third one... wait I don't want to give you my address...
 - Took some time to calm down.
 - Researched for some paid hosting servies in Hong Kong
 - Thought about faith and faithfulness
 - Made up my mind and decided I want to serve students with the best I could provide,
   so let's do it if I need to pay a monthly fee.
 - ... and realized that I could give GitHub Pages one more try tomorrow ...

28/8 Friday

 - Pray
 - Experiment with GitHub Pages... it works!
 - Separate the 700-line file into parts
 - UI improvements
   > control area at bottom instead of top
   > if changed to landscape, control area goes to the right
   > double the size of everything
     (button, split bar, text, stroke width)

31/8 Monday

 - Phone test from weekend
   > font size is OK
   > split bar OK
   > solved: incorrect layout when just switched from portrait to landscape
             due to variable text box size
   > solved: f fox and p box sizes can go to zero in landscape mode
 - Used MIT license instead of CC license (LOL)
 - Modified main layout to give space for menu

1/9 Tuesday

 - Finish implementing the menu
 - implemented the debug log, by the way
 - Upload
 - Tidied files on GitHub, used separate .txt file for license
 - Phone test 2
   > issue: size of "doc" becomes small when full screen is on
            (i.e. all the texts and icons becomes large)

2/9 Wednesday

 - tried "transform: scale" in CSS but it messes up jQuery, so no.
 - came up with the idea of "document coordinates" with functions to access it
 - implemented "document coordinates" from ground-up and fixed the sizing issue
 - tidied up the code and wrote comments
 - upload again
